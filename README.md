# Clock.cpp
 C++ code Chada Tech has domestic and international clients. To meet international standard ISO 8601, Chada Tech wants their clients to be able to view a 12- and a 24-hour clock on their website rather than just the standard 12-hour clock.



# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving-
This project is for a company called Chada Tech. This software engineering company needs a standard 24-hour clock to meet domestic and international clients' needs on their website. 

# What did you do particularly well?
What I did particularly well was to give the most a good product of code with the limited coding knowledge I had which solved the needs of the 24-hour website clock. I kept to software standards which kept the code clean and needed comments for important steps in the process. 


# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could of made my code a little more organized and more compiled without useless lines for the most efficient code and less wasted memory space. 

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?


# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
The most important skills I learn from this project and that I will be transferring to other projects are the logical breakdown for the needs of the client and their end goals. It's hard to just start coding without the foundation of what you need to code. With a step-by-step process that is logical I am able to proceed with making software from my brain to write computer code on the screen. 

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable by providing clean cut code that was logical to follow along with easy-to-understand comments and functions that made this code efficient. The code is maintainable by its use case for the 24-hour website. This code works as intended by the company end goal.
